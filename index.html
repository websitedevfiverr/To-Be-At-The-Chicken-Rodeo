      { title: "To Speak Well", content: `Much work for an English poet today\nWords like feeling stripped of meaning\nMurdered words\nBullet holes where shame hides\n\nI want to understand what I say and believe it too\nIf I always said just what I meant\nI'd be a beacon of love\nConsiderate and wanting to help\nActivated in the heart\nFree from deceit's chains\n\nSeeking words to place on a pedestal\nTo which all tongues oughta be pointed\nWhat must be spoken or unspoken\nThe long and short\nNeither here nor there\n\nTo find them in mind\nRegardless of misunderstanding\nOr trying to get anything through\nSimply the case as it's standing\nTo draw the law and define the line\nTo stand in place and be honest\n\nSearching for freedom in mind\nTo see things clear\nThe approach too the point\nTo scale the gate and break the chain\nAnd claim the crown unscathed\n\nMany things in the scheme of reality\n1 thing in mind\nA striving to be\nCan't be everything\nStruggling just to be 1\nI want to be real\nIn the balance\nIn tune with reality\nTo find the needle in the haystack\n\nStriving to be someone I want to be\nTo be someone people strive to be\nTo be like the Uffizi\nSomething seen beyond the crumbling tile\nI'd like to be a fully bloomed oak\nStrong, fruitful, and beyond trial\nBut I'll never be if I don't grow\n\nLeaving petty gossip for general truth\nA new way to speak which is old\nWhen language was of God\nAnd hope wasn't a myth\nReferring to etymology\nSpeaking Latin and Greek\nTo infuse life with meaning\nAnd satisfy human design\n\nI don't know about God\nBut I know of hope\nAnd believe in the heart\n\nI can't sacrifice to what I don't believe\nLike a terrorist who's never seen God\nFooled by fear to not face the world\nJust another cheese trap\nAnother supposed easy out\nThe university fantasy\nAn excuse to give up on dreams\n\nMy belief is not fuel for ego's illusion\nThey've not been implanted in me\nFree from theory's chains\nUnburdened by any grand theory\nmy belief to progress as it please\nMe not to deny what I believe\n\nNot red or blue but pale beige\nNot right or left but walking straight\nWhat use such tools when your mind is a mess?\nWhy so adamant in confusion?\nWhat use debating beginning or end?\nYou've opened your door to a minion of death's\nThe theory of days merely a heavy delay\n\nI Forgot my crime\nNow I'm blind\nTroubled and don't know why\nEither paranoia\nOr something I can't see is holding me\n\nI write like a doctor to save my life\nProblems in mind to define\nSo I can find the cure\nLooking for a good word\nWrestling with a notebook\nDrawing circles around truth\nPlaying triangles and squares\n\nThe things I keep which ruin me\nWithout thinking why I need them\nBecause they've been there ever since I remember\nSnuck by the whole time\nNothing will be left unconsidered\n\nShame for nothing but shame\nHidden with more shame\nSome never grow past such things\nRuined for nothing but dreading to see\n\nMurmurs of the heart unrealized\nI try to pin them down in words\nExpose their empty threat or receive their great gift\n\nNow I see many were right\nI was worse than a dog with a stick\nHe sharpens his teeth\nI ruined my mind\nMuddied the water\nDug the pit out of which to climb\nBuilt the labyrinth and got lost\nPassing the moment\nWasting time unsatisfied\nBuried my heart practicing nonsense I'd forget in a second\nTwiddling thumbs and mind numbing tongues\n\nBecause my words were big and loud I was crowned\nBut I didn't realize my responsibility\nI was sent to the guillotine\n\nStayed on the train til the end of the line\nClaimed the shame and paid the fine\nI tried running but found I was chained\nEvery inch you go a chip in your soul\nI went the wrong way and got burned\nAll scars down the road\nThose sustained my own mistakes\nWrong responses to bad luck\nYou realize what you must respect\nLook at the past as a stepping stone\nAll the wrong turns and miles of road\nTake it with gratitude\nLet it shine a light\n\nIt wasn't for nothing\nIt brought me closer to the truth\nI wasn't indecisive or procrastinating\nI was deceived and thrown off the trail\nDistracted from my own needs\nBut I did what I believed\nEven when It changed\nSome day I'll crack the chain\nMove on or remain\n\nI've had my youth in folly and play\nBut the duty of men is to leave such away\nCruel jokes I made without bothering to see\nI was responsible for the way thigs should be\n\nI'm less than I was\nI was a complicated mess\nNow I'm an engine in a direction\nbound like a hound\nStriving to be\nSimply living\nBut yet in the mess\nWith many questions which can't be ignored\n\nNow I'll be disappointment before entertainment to nonsense\nIf it sparks in my heart I'll snuff it\nIf it seeks me to fan it I'll blow it out\nI'll turn all talk to good\nA graveyard of weeds\nA garden of trees\n\nAware of the motives of men with shut lips\nI will be the one sought after seeking good\nA confidant to reach and cling to\nBut I won't be a blockbuster for envy's evil eye\nI'll be invisible to dullards like a bullfighter\nI'll be like a good riddle\nReproof soft\nFelt but not thought\n\nI wake up in the morning\nAnd it seems all I've done's become nothing\nI'm not all there\nBut in truth I've come far\nI work day by day\nEven without clear gain\nAnd what use to even try to understand?\nSome claim it a futile task\nBut it's what I want to do\n\nHistory and human nature\nHow it's always been\nIn the ruins of high minds\nBlind lead blind\nHe who sees only in time may be free to speak\nChaos turning chaos lets in a bit of light\nSome might chase it but its shut again\nAnd in the light some seek the dark\nTo hide away their shame\n\nWhat's new is you've forgotten what you knew\nYou can try to learn the truth but it's easier to forget\nComfort turns out the light and leaves you crying in the dark\nSacrificing memory to forgetting\nRemembering that it's easy\nBut the suffering makes it harder\nSabotaging your dreams to relax and take it easy\nThen the final sleep comes with a shock\n\nYou see garbage on the screen\nAnd pigs at the trough\nPandering trash for a senseless mass\nFunded by a dull king's cash\nOnly for juggling does one earn a home\nPockets as full as empty the soul\nMerchants merely see the chart\nThey don't care for quality\nWhat's bought and sold is cheap\nSo the world is cheap\nYour city's made of plastic\nAnd you replace it every week\n\nCompromising taste to fit in\nLost in the mess like the rest\nAnother pawn in a senseless scheme\nWhere no one sees the end\nInterpreted and misunderstood by others\nWithout the crown of certification\nLost in the crowd\nUnfollowed out\n\nNovelty passes and you're left empty\nPoetry might make you laugh\nBut what's left should make you cry\nOld cheap songs beaten to death\nPawning off novelties just like the rest\nIt rings contritely but it's a lie\nSenseless imitation\nMeaningless singing\nDistraction and detraction from life\nThe songs are no good so fade away\nIllusions of the moment which with the morning break\nOne of a billion songs lost to time\nNo one remembered because they didn't rhyme\n\nYou want the world to be a better place\nBut you too are a part\nAnd have much to work on\nNo one needs a foolish saint \nRunning for the bucket for the child drowning in the lake\nAching hearts which only sit around and cry\nNo one going to turn on the light\n\nGood words bring life together\nGood Society upheld by good leadership\nGood morale and satisfied workers\nLighting what's dark\nFounded on communication\nSociety founded on hard truth\nWashed away when decision can't be made\nTripping over the bullet holes in language\n\nYou're wanted at your best\nNot as a cheap imitation\nI write for myself\nI'll be writing what people really want\nPoetry of the heart\nWhat I love and don't\nNot going through the motions but really doing it\nI lose the world to abandon myself\nThrough I is it all tied\n\nDefined by the world\nMany things in the scheme of reality \nBut 1 thing in mind\nIn a world obscured by lies\nSometimes meanings change to rhyme\nBut I won't deceive myself to rhyme\nOnce I'm free to sing \nThen I'll try to rhyme\n\nPoetry and music\n2 sides of the coin of language\nNot pictures but human function\nNot crumbling in a museum\nNot joking in the beerhall\nClinging to pretty pictures passed\nNo distractions or detractions from life\nEvery moment pure living\nIn the present and towards the future\nPrimordial\nFree from the specifically human disease of sentimentality\n\nMusic is solid\nDiscovered like truth\nLike truth always coming through\nThe sculpture hidden in the rock\nIf you don't believe it you'll never find it\nI try to make good music whether I learn from it or don't\nWhether I succeed or don't\n\nThere are many kinds of songs\nBut they’re all on one road\nThe world is reality \nThe paved road what's right\nIt's the heart\nDifferent emotions and experiences going down one road\nI don't sing about\nI'm a sparrow in the sun\n\nMeasurement’s not found in mind but in the world with a ruler\nSo I satisfy myself but don't know what I'm worth\nIt's self-satisfaction i seek\nSimply in vision manifest\n\nObvious things are useless to me\nIf i find the heart a lie \nThen I'll be free\nI have to do what I want or else I’d be hopeless\nI live a life I want to live because I have hope\nIf I didn't it'd be because I'm hopeless\nIf I didn't I'd be hopeless\n\nTo live in fear you’re already ruined\nYou'll never live\nSo I’ll stand tall to death\nDie in my footsteps\nNot live the life of a worm\nWho makes his home in his grave\n\nIf you don't believe in yourself you can't have any belief\nLucky to believe or cursed\nYet one is stuck with a curse until it's broken\nSo I have no choice but to go\nOr forever go against my belief\nTo discover the truth is itself freedom\n\nWhy shouldn't I follow belief out of the mud?\nRemain in despair accepting it as inescapable\nWhen I feel a rope to pull me through\nTo give up like a donkey with flies in the eyes\nWho doesn't mind the leeches on its skin\nWhy be so adamant in confusion?\nTo abandon belief for a nonsensical plan\nForsake the bird in hand\nIt'd be suicide\nMy heart would stop and I'd die\n\nI will yet be free\nI'll yet have succeeded\nSomething few try to do\nThe first of my ancestral line\nWho's soul has bore fruit\nWhen I'm finished\nThen I'll consider having kids\nAnd they will grow with certified light\n\nTo accomplish a discovery of life\nEscape the chain of command\nPerhaps a slave to the world\nBut free in the mind\n\nPerhaps my work is rough\nBut I can't be doing detail on second hand walking shoes\nThen I'll never get through\nFarming metaphors\nStrategies of war\nAnalogies of the heart\nHoles in my shoes\nStruggling just to get through\nWhere there’s a problem there’s work to do\nI’m not yet free\n\nOn the way you see a goal\nPast the end you're simply free\nAll seems a line of logic in the end\nBut all it was was a beating heart` },

Her image summoned my heart from a sleep so long I forgot it was there.\n\tI took her trembling hands as a sign besides subtler tokens we were both bestricken. Instantly, all ambitions of class climbing lifted with the veil, and for the first time in a long time I wasn't blind. Yet I  noticed not, for my sight was fixed on the intruder, and I couldn't even think to turn them away. I was like a baby newly born, my mind was blank and world was new, I was merely passing through a phase. \n\tShe spoke double-tongued as is the language of love. She presented the menu, but with the registers of her voice, bodily movement, placement, and posture, she set upon my heart as a snake., caught my eyes and tickled my ears. My presentation conformed to acceptable standards of a menu presentation's audience, and I felt she performed under similar conditions.\n\tBut I never discovered her mind, nor her mine, as the charade was played til the curtains closed, then the actors all went home. Reality is the ultimate director and spectator of tragedy, all that could've been that never was, because it remained hidden, to let illusion lead us astray. But the reality is it was meant to be that way, as that's the case. Either way, I was young and immature. A car's nothing without a driver.\n\tThough you might sit around and sort people according to your standards, judge people based on their habits or actions, beliefs or traits, clothes or appearance, race or sex, wealth or health, these are all empty words when lightning strikes.` },
